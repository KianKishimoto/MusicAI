Goal is to create a software that can map any given music video onto an uploaded song.

- Input: mp3 file (later implement just song name), music video youtube link
- Output: mp4 file of mapped video and inputted song playing in the background


mp3 file -> madmom beat tracking/tempo
link -> download to mp4 -> convert to mp3 (if mp4 isnt acceptable input) -> madmom beat tracking/tempo
...
---> beat matching -> overlay scaled video with mp3 input -> output mp4
